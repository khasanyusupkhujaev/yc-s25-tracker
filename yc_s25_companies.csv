1) High quality datasets for benchmarking and evaluations
2) Realistic sandbox environments for safe and accurate testing/training (ex. a simulated version of Salesforce)

Our evaluation service combines proprietary datasets with high quality annotations to help our customers identify and prioritize the biggest failure modes of their computer- and browser- use AI.

They get hundreds if not thousands of reported issues monthly—most never read by anyone who understands the whole system. De-duping is a chore. Related issues get filed twenty times under different teams. The result: teams spend hundreds of hours just figuring out what the most important items are, before they can even start fixing them.

Janet AI is the AI-native ticket triage and management layer for Jira.

Janet AI watches every incoming ticket and immediately compares it to everything that’s come before. It builds a knowledge graph: which tickets look like the same underlying bug, which roll up into the same component failure, which issues share the same root cause. With this, it surfaces duplicate or related issues, auto-detects fixes mentioned in these related tickets, and identifies those that matter most.

Because the data’s structured, useful questions become instantly answerable using the Janet AI Chat Agent's contextual intelligence. “What are the highest priority login bugs hitting enterprise customers running version X?” “How should I fix issue PROJ-123?” “What are the most critical issues related to PROJ-456 and how should I prioritize these?”

Several multi‑billion‑dollar enterprises are already in talks with Janet AI to reduce the manual work involved in managing tickets at scale.

Our platform integrates directly into existing university systems (SIS, LMS, CRM), learns each institution’s unique workflows, and deploys specialized AI agents. This dramatically reduces the $735 billion universities spend annually on administrative labor, expands staff capacity without increasing headcount, and improves the student experience.

This hasn't been done before because university workflows require nuanced, autonomous judgment, exactly what agentic AI was designed to solve. Our team uniquely combines deep expertise in higher education, enterprise-scale AI, and regulated enterprise sales.

Sadia previously built Salesforce’s Education Cloud from scratch, creating the core Student Information System widely used across higher education. She deeply understands university operations and maintains trusted relationships with hundreds of higher-ed CIOs and Provosts.

Danial was one of DoorDash’s earliest engineers, where he architected and scaled complex systems from zero to billions of transactions, including their search, recommendation, and Voice AI platforms. He knows how to build robust AI solutions that reliably perform at enterprise scale.

Today, fraud and risk teams at fintechs and banks are overwhelmed. Analysts jump between tools, manually stitch together context, and make judgment calls under pressure, often for hundreds of alerts a week. Too much of their work is slow, repetitive, and error-prone. We're here to change that. 

Socratix gives fraud and risk teams AI coworkers that investigate alerts in real time, replacing manual reviews with fast, explainable decisions. Socratix agents plug into existing workflows and reason across signals just like human analysts to help teams reduce fraud losses, minimize false positives, and scale operations without scaling headcount.

We've seen this problem firsthand. At DoorDash, Riya helped save $30M+ a year by building smarter fraud detection and investigation tooling, and at Unit21, she built products for analysts that made them 3X faster. We're able to build and sell enterprise-grade software. At Cruise, Satya built scalable AI systems powering petabyte-scale data, and at LinkedIn, he built enterprise products from 0 to 1 generating $50M+ in incremental revenue. Now, the two of us are teaming up to eliminate the manual toil in fraud and risk.

We’re taking a new approach by building everything from the ground up for AI. Since June, 3000+ users have created over 4000 apps on Floot.

Existing AI app builders fall short of enabling non-coders to build real, serious apps. They often:
- Break down when building anything more than a prototype or toy app
- Have non-coders stuck with errors they don’t understand
- Require non-coders to handle multiple services designed for developers (e.g. for backend, database, hosting, etc)

The fundamental problem: these AI app builders just cobble together existing developer tools and slap AI on top, but these tools were designed for humans and not for AI.

The result? Non-coders get excited, start building, hit a wall, and then abandon their projects.

Floot is purpose-built for AI. Our secret sauce:
1) Instead of reusing a coding framework designed for humans, we created a specialized framework that dictates how AI should write code and how the code runs on our infrastructure. This allows us to enforce best practices, detect errors earlier, and give the best feedback to the AI. As a result, Floot can write better code and fix issues more effectively.
2) Floot has the entire tech stack built-in (backend, database, hosting, etc) so building and managing an app feels seamless, especially for non-coders. And because we control every layer of the stack, we can optimize each layer for AI-first coding.

Because of this, non-coders can get more done with less time and prompting. They can finally build serious apps that work, instead of getting stuck in frustrating error loops and then abandoning their projects.

We also built a highly scalable hosting system directly on AWS so Floot apps can handle real traffic and business demands. This means non-coders can build, deploy, and scale their apps on a single platform seamlessly.

In less than five months, we helped sixty patients erase or reduce over $280K from their medical bills.

• Existing audit software is static: Decades-old rule engines can’t keep pace with evolving codes, contracts, or billing tactics.

Restaurants lose up to $100,000 per year per location from missed calls, lost orders, and abandoned hold lines. Staff are overwhelmed. IVRs frustrate customers. Call centers are expensive and impersonal.

It’s 2025. Guests don’t leave voicemails or wait on hold. They just move on.

Certus is an AI voice agent built for restaurants. It answers every call, 24/7 — taking orders, processing deliveries, booking reservations, upselling, and handling complaints in English, Spanish, French and more. Certus is built to manage the phone line end to end, from the customer call to the restaurant tech stack, with zero human intervention required. It currently integrates with industry-leading systems like Toast, Square, Clover, UberEats, DoorDash, and more.

We’re building the voice layer of the modern restaurant — the employee they’ll never fire.

We started Certus because we lived the pain. Gurveer (CEO) grew up answering phones in his family’s restaurant and helped operate them, growing from 1 to 11 locations in 7 years. Later, he and Adam (CRO) ran a restaurant growth startup to help others increase revenue, but kept watching clients bleed cash because no one picked up the phone. So we built the solution the industry always wished existed.

Until now, this problem was considered unsolvable. But Voice AI has finally crossed the conversational chasm and 72% of consumers now prefer AI over humans as long as it means faster and better service.

More importantly, the market is begging for this. The North American restaurant industry crossed $1 trillion in 2024, and it's projected to hit $1.5 trillion in 2025. Yet over $100 billion is still lost annually to missed calls, human error, and outdated tech. As the market continues to grow, so do the losses!

Our customers say it best:

- “Certus changed my life overnight.”
- “We were losing the ability to give great in-house service — the phone was killing us.”
-  “70% of my business comes through the phone. That’s mine and my 16 staffs livelihood.”
- “Before Certus, I used to lose 40 - 60 calls a day…. now my printer just stays printing!”
-  “I’ve been in the business 38 years. I’ve been waiting for this since then.”

Certus is here to fix the $120B phone problem — one call at a time.

And in doing so, we’re redefining how the restaurant industry communicates forever, starting with the phone line.",Replacing the restaurant phone line with Voice AI,3.0,B2B,B2B,1753135662,"['Artificial Intelligence', 'SaaS', 'B2B', 'Restaurant Tech', 'AI']",[],False,False,False,Summer 2025,Active,['B2B'],"['United States of America', 'America / Canada']",Early,False,False,,False,https://www.ycombinator.com/companies/certus-ai,https://yc-oss.github.io/api/batches/summer-2025/certus-ai.json,https://www.ycombinator.com/companies/certus-ai

We're starting by helping the ag and mining industry track stockpiles of grain and gravel.

Bulk inventory tracking is broken. Companies either rely on guesstimates or pay for expensive manual surveys which are still off by 20 to 30%. Without accurate numbers, it’s hard to plan logistics, like how many truckloads are needed. And it creates accounting issues by misreporting inventory value, hurting financial planning and leading to missed opportunities.

We’ve lived this problem, and we know how to solve it. Warren saw it firsthand as a Product Manager at Milk Moovement, a $20M Series A AgTech startup, working closely with feed suppliers and farm managers. Jordan scaled Microsoft Azure’s largest public API, handling over 700M requests/month, and sold software to a public company. Cole was engineer #3 at Tropic, scaling it from seed to Series B, and later led engineering at an AI startup.

We’ve built an integrated hardware and software platform that’s now being piloted by some of the largest agriculture and construction companies in North America. As industries demand real-time visibility into the physical world, dScribe AI is positioned to become the system of record for inventory that don’t fit in traditional boxes and barcodes.

The accounting profession is facing a massive talent shortage, as graduates choose different professions and the old guard begins to retire. As a result, CPA and tax preparation firms are awash in clientele, but unable to keep up. At many firms, phones go unanswered, clients are ""fired"", and websites are taken down, as the existing workforce tries to handle the grueling 80 hour+ weeks necessary to push through tax season to the April 15th deadline.

We built this because a former colleague who owns her own tax firm asked us to automate her workload, and we quickly realized the massive opportunity. Thomas brings deep domain expertise as the former Head of Product at Keeper (YC W19), where he built tax engine automation systems and an OCR form scanning system that outperformed everything else on the market. At Keeper, he leveraged early access to OpenAI's LLMs (well before ChatGPT) to build systems that automated the entire tax filing process, allowing a tiny team of CPAs to process thousands of returns with near zero busy work. Patrick was the first engineer at FunCraft, shipping multiple mobile games with 1M+ downloads and building scalable shared codebases. We've worked together since 2017, including co-leading multiple teams at Zynga as PM & Tech Lead respectively.

We launched this year in the middle of tax season and quickly processed hundreds of returns, earning thousands in ARR, and since tax season we've been growing customers by >30% month-over-month. We've completely automated over 25% of the return process so far and developed a proprietary vision model that beats incumbent scanning technology by almost 2x on accuracy - jumping from 50% field-level accuracy to 89%, approaching the quality of their expensive human-verified service at 92%.

The opportunity is massive - there are 80M US personal tax returns filed via professionals annually, in a $2B outsourcing market where individual CPA firms currently pay $100k-$1M per year for inferior services. We're positioned to capture significant market share by offering better accuracy & document coverage, instant processing, and superior user experience.

Pakistan is the 5th most populous country in the world with a $411 billion GDP. Yet its overlooked and no practical voice models exist for the local languages.

With our APIs and SDKs, businesses offer high-quality voice interfaces in domains like banking, agriculture, healthcare, and government services. This enables them to finally offer digital services to every customer -- often for the first time.

Our founding team has a decade of experience building world-leading voice products, including at Alexa and Siri. We have launched entire AWS services; and software written by us previously is used by millions daily.

We do in-house research and development. We gather our own data, then train and deploy our own models. We own our technology stack end-to-end.

Most assistants today, such as Siri, Alexa, or Gemini, are limited to narrow functions like setting timers or answering questions. They cannot message your friends on Messenger, send money on Venmo, or compare ride-share prices to book the best option.

Blue can do all of this and more.

It taps, swipes, and types like a human on both Android and iPhone, so it doesn't need any app-specific integrations. This is made possible through a voice-first computer-use model as well as a custom hardware. 

It already works in the real world. Users are texting, shopping, and navigating their phones completely hands-free. People who are commuting, cooking, or multitasking are using Blue to reclaim meaningful time during their day.

Our team brings rare and highly complementary experience. Omar led Google Assistant’s transition to LLMs and holds one of the earliest patents in LLM-based computer control. Peter brings decades of experience designing and building voice-first dialog systems, holds multiple design patents, and was most recently the design lead at Google DeepMind serving actions on the Gemini Live model. Farhan helped ship Apple’s Vision Pro and holds more than 50 patents in hardware and systems design. He's also led several products end-to-end from early prototyping to mass production and global fulfillment.

Together, we have built systems used by billions of people and are now building something even more fundamental: re-inventing the way we use and interact with technology.",The first voice assistant that can control every app on your phone.,3.0,Consumer,Consumer,1753836546,"['Hardware', 'Speech Recognition', 'AI', 'AI Assistant']",[],False,False,False,Summer 2025,Active,['Consumer'],"['United States of America', 'America / Canada']",Early,False,False,,False,https://www.ycombinator.com/companies/blue,https://yc-oss.github.io/api/batches/summer-2025/blue.json,https://www.ycombinator.com/companies/blue
