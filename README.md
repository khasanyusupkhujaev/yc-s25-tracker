# YC S25 Companies Tracker

A Streamlit app that tracks and displays startups from the **Y Combinator Summer 2025 (S25) batch**.  
The app collects official YC data, enriches company profiles with LinkedIn information, and provides an interactive dashboard for exploration.

---

## Features

- **Official YC Directory Integration**  
  Fetches the full list of S25 companies via the YC OSS API.

- **LinkedIn Enrichment**  
  Uses Google search results (via Serper.dev API) to find LinkedIn company pages.  
  Flags companies that explicitly mention **“YC S25”** in their LinkedIn title or description — including those *not listed* on the official YC directory.

- **Interactive Dashboard**  
  Powered by [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io) with:
  - Search by company name  
  - Filter for companies mentioning YC S25  
  - Metrics: total companies & YC S25 mentions  
  - Clickable links to websites, YC pages, and LinkedIn profiles  

- **Data Deduplication**  
  Ensures no duplicate companies are displayed.
